GDPR Best Practices for Personal Data Handling

1) Lawful Basis & Minimization:
- Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.
- Only collect and keep data necessary for the purpose (data minimization).

2) PII Detection & Handling:
- Personal Identifiers include: name, email, phone, national id numbers, addresses, date of birth.
- Sensitive personal data (racial, health, biometric) requires special handling and usually should not be stored.

3) Masking/Redaction:
- When sharing datasets, mask personal identifiers (e.g., show only domain part of email or hash names).
- Mask phone numbers by masking middle digits (e.g., +1-123-***-7890).
- Tokenization or hashing is acceptable when re-identification is not needed.

4) Retention & Deletion:
- Personal data must be retained only as long as necessary; provide delete/forget mechanism.

5) Access Controls:
- Restrict access to PII to authorized roles only. Use logs/audits.

6) Consent & Purpose:
- Keep records of consent; do not use data beyond the agreed purpose.

7) Audit & Explainability:
- Every automated masking action must be logged, with reason and policy reference.

8) Policy References:
- All fixes should reference these rules and the specific clause that justifies the action.
